# Example-Website
HMTL, CSS, and a bit of of jQuery practice

<p>Just a random practice website I put together today. </p>

<p>Changes to be made:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Make responsive (designed with this in mind, just need to add media queries)</li>
    <li>Change the form so it doesn't pull up an empty email and just sends it straight from the page</li>
